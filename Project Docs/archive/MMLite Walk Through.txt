MM Lite Walk through 
28th Feb 2012

This s an internal approval meeting

not all events to be handled by netcool
	24 service affecting alarms handled in the first phase


Alarms from cell stack are already dealt with so we expect no changes to mttrapd rules

All alarms not in the alarm list will be stored in netool - these may or may not be enriched and NOT seen in std views
	Care to be taken with service/resilience affecting and action required flags
	Care with IPT events that are going through MMLite


Circee 	Performance monitoring
	is this an oracle db? 
	if so an something be done with STATS pack
